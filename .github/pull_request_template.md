# [Language] Addition/Modification

<!-- If you need help add the `help-wanted` label -->

## Description
<!-- This field is required if you modified a language. If that's the case, explain us why you modified that language. Otherwise this field is optional. -->

## I have verified that

- Every argument variable (`{0}`, `{1}`, ...) remained the same.
- There isn't an other pull request with the same language.
- I escaped every double quote with a backslash (`"` -> `\"`).
- The JSON syntax is valid.
